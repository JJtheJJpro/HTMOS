# HTMOS

An Operating System, with an HTML parser, that executes any cross-platform executable and gives a wide variety of settings for any user, new or experienced.

Stages will go as follows with given target achievements, from top to bottom:

- Pre-Alpha (the beginnings, file systems, memory management, acpi, oem stuff, etc., this part will take a while)
- Alpha (A nice display shows, a minimal HTML parser and JavaScript engine works)
- Pre-Beta (will be marked Beta with versions before 1.0, better HTML parser and JS engine, first test Windows Executable runs and works)
- Beta 1.0+ (multiple test Windows Executables run and work, not sure how many yet)
- Beta 2.0+ (multiple test Linux Executables run and work)
- Beta 3.0+ (multiple test MacOS Executables run and work)
- Beta 4.0+ (multiple test BSD Executables run and work)
- Pre-Release (release version before 1.0, implement driver support)
- The RC Phase (RC=Release Candidate, this whole phase will be nothing but bug fixes and touch ups)
- The First Release of The HyperText Markup Operating System

This will be a project that will not be forgotten.
